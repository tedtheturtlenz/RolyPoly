# RolyPoly
 A Remote-Contolled Sphere-Shaped Robot



This is a currently active repository for my Roly Poly robot.
Most up to date code is in "Active".

* The Android APKs in "App" are various versions of an app I created using MIT App Inventor to control the robot.

* The Arduino code in "Code" are the various versions of the control code running on Roly Poly

Roly Poly is controlled by an Arduino Pro Micro, with various other components including:
Voltage regulators
Battery management system
Motor Controller
HC-05 Bluetooth Module
MPU6050 IMU
Logic Level Shifter

to make Roly Poly function successfully.
